# Applied Econometrics: Impact of COVID-19 on the Stock Market


## Project Overview

This project investigates the impact of economic variables and the COVID-19 pandemic on the stock market, specifically the S&P 500 index. Using econometric modeling, multiple regression models were developed to analyze the relationships between mobility, oil prices, government interventions, and financial indicators during the pandemic. The study applies rigorous statistical testing to refine the model and ensure accuracy.


## Objective

To formulate an econometric model that explains variations in the S&P 500 index based on economic indicators and pandemic-related factors, providing insights into market behavior during crises.


## Data Sources

Mobility data: IHME (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation)

Stock market data: Yahoo Finance

Oil Prices: West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent Crude (FRED Economic Data)

Gold Prices: London Bullion Market

Bond Yields: U.S. 10-Year Sovereign Bonds


## Methodology

Model Development: Four econometric models were built, each refining the selection of variables based on statistical significance and diagnostic tests.

Variable Selection: Factors such as mobility changes, oil prices, gold prices, and bond yields were considered due to their theoretical link to stock market movements.

Regression Analysis: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression was used to estimate the impact of each variable on the S&P 500 index.

Diagnostic Testing:

Multicollinearity: Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) was used to detect and eliminate highly correlated regressors.

Autocorrelation: Breusch-Godfrey test identified serial correlation, corrected using HAC standard errors.

Misspecification Errors: Ramseyâ€™s RESET test ensured correct functional form.

Normality: Jarque-Bera test assessed residual distribution.


## Key Findings

Mobility and Stock Market Movements: Increased mobility correlated positively with stock market growth, indicating economic confidence.

Impact of Oil Prices: Initially, WTI crude was included but found insignificant. Brent Crude was a better predictor of stock market changes.

Effect of Gold Prices: Contrary to expectations, gold prices showed a weak positive correlation with the stock market, likely due to investor shifts to bonds and cash holdings instead.

Pandemic Announcements: Government interventions and major pandemic-related news negatively impacted the S&P 500 index.

Sovereign Bond Yields: Increased bond yields positively correlated with stock market movements, aligning with investor expectations of risk-return trade-offs.

## Final Model

The final regression model includes:

Mobility Change

Brent Crude Oil Prices

Pandemic-Related Events (Dummy Variable)

Gold Prices

10-Year Sovereign Bond Yields

This model explains 92.95% of the variation in the S&P 500 index with all variables statistically significant at the 1% level.
